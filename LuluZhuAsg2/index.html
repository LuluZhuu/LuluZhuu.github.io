                    Hi there! I'm Lulu Zhu. I currently major in Computer Science and Data Science at NYU, with a minor in Web Programming and Applications.
                    The power of crafting user interfaces and experiences that seamlessly blend aesthetics and technology is a driving force behind my academic pursuits.
                    As I delved deeper into this field, I discovered the immense impact that front-end development has on shaping the online world we interact with daily.
                    With my passion for aesthetics, I aim to seamlessly integrate this interest with my major, 
                    creating a harmonious blend that allows me to make a meaningful impact in the digital realm.

                <p class=".col-75" onclick="swapT()" id="p1">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a fundamental technology in web development. 
                    It serves as the design language for web pages, allowing developers to control the layout, appearance, and presentation of HTML elements. 
                    CSS enables the separation of content from design, making it easier to create visually appealing and responsive websites. 
                    With CSS, you can set fonts, colors, margins, and more, ensuring consistency and a polished look across your site. 
                    It operates on a cascade principle, where rules can be inherited, overridden, or combined to create complex styles. 
                    Mastering CSS is essential for creating engaging and user-friendly web interfaces.
                </p>
            <p onclick="swapT()" id="p2">JavaScript (JS) is a versatile and powerful programming language that plays a pivotal role in web development. 
                It empowers developers to create dynamic and interactive web applications by adding functionality to HTML and CSS. 
                JavaScript is executed on the client-side, enabling real-time updates, user interactions, and data manipulation without the need for server requests. 
                It's used for tasks ranging from form validation to building complex web applications and games. 
                JavaScript's wide adoption and extensive libraries, such as React and Angular, make it a must-learn language for web developers. 
                With JS, you can bring your web projects to life, making them more engaging and responsive to user input.
